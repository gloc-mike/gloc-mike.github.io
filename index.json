So I went to the command line and dutifully entered npm install -g jshint thinking that it would fix the problem. It did not! ‚òπÔ∏è\nA bit of searching on the net dredged up this very problem on StackOverflow. This answer was particularly helpful! Thanks Abdollah! üëç üôÇ\nWhat I took from the SO issue was that the solution requires two steps:\nIssue npm install -g jshint (done ‚úÖ üòÑ) and then, Configure the jshint node path in the VS Code preferences (not yet ‚ùé üôÅ). So, what is the global node path on my device?\nTo find that out, one must use the npm root -g command. Use that command if you are using npm AND you specifically want to find the global root, otherwise use npm root to to find the local node path. üëç\nHere is a short asciinema asciicast of the process:\nAs I said, I want the location of the global node path and for me that is /usr/local/lib/node_modules. This location is the location relevant to a Homebrew install. If you installed node via nvm, then the location on macos is more likely to be something like ~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules.\nFinally, open VS Code Settings, search for jshint node path in the Search settings field and then enter the global node path i.e. again, for me it\u0026rsquo;s /usr/local/lib/node_modules.\nAfter setting the jshint node path you can check it by opening the Command Palette and typing show output.\nThe output window should show something like this:\n1 [Info - 10:45:37 PM] jshint library loaded from /usr/local/lib/node_modules/jshint/src/jshint.js Et voil√†! üòÖ\nUpdate 1:\nI originally installed node via Homebrew but this is apparently not best practice since a package manager (brew) is installing another package manager (npm) so I have uninstalled the brewed version of node and reinstalled the most recent version (v12.18.3 at time of publishing) via nvm.\nFind a description of the issue here.\nFind the GitHub nvm repo here.\nUpdate 2:\nThe \u0026ldquo;VS Code JSHint extension\u0026rdquo; setup documentation says that the extension will look in the jshint module in the current directory and in the global package location \u0026hellip; maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just me, but the extension does not seem to look in the global location and I had to update the jshint node path with the correct path.\nFind the JSHint extension repo here on GitHub.\nü¶∏ üé¢\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-08-22/","summary":"When using VS Code with jshint installed I would get the following error displayed whenever I opened a JavaScript project: I want jshint to be available globally \u0026hellip; I want it to be available in all JavaScript projects.
